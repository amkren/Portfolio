            <h3 class="text-centered color-text">Guest Service Associate Turned Developer</h3>

            <p>As a guest service associate I learned all there is to know about how to talk to customers and deliver excellent service. 
                Combining that with technical skills earned throughout my time in the Thinkful Software Developer Certification, 
                I aim to begin an illustrious career in Software Development</p>

                <h3 class="color-text">As a Developer I Aim To</h3>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>Create designs that are beautiful and eyecatching to the users</li>
                <li>Create code that is beautiful and readable for my team</li>
                <li>Create, iterate, recreate, and reiterate</li>

            <h3 class="color-text"><i><b>Passionate, Creative, Driven</b></i></h3>
            <p class="smaller-text">For years I have dreamed about being a developer, and I am now well on my way.
                                    Putting towards 5 hours a day, minimum, I plan to finish my Thinkful 
                                    program under the estimated time in order to ensure I can break into the industry and begin the learning process all over again.</p>
            <p class="smaller-text">In order to become a great developer, one must be willing to work in a team. 
                As someone who has worked on many teams, in many different industries, I believe I can meld into any team, and perhaps lead just as well.</p>
